Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent: The church season centered around fasting and penitence, full of reminders of our sin and the price that Jesus paid to redeem us.

Our reading today focuses on two basic points:

1. That fasting is a religious practice that is susceptible to hypocrisy: “Look at how good I am; I’m giving [this or that] up for Lent”. Jesus doesn’t tell us not to fast; rather, he tells us that we shouldn’t make a show of it.
2. “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”. Our treasure is our priority. We treasure what we love. When we love or treasure anything more than God, we are guilty of breaking the First Commandment.

Mammon is an old word. It’s such an old word that newer translations of the Bible have replaced it with money. Mammon is essentially wealth. Something to be used, but definitely not to be worshiped. I’m reminded of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%206%3A6-10&version=ESV][1 Timothy 6:6–10]]

If we truly fear, love, and trust in God above all things, then we have no reason to be overly concerned with mammon. We can invest it, spend it, and generally be good stewards of it when we have it, but it need not consume us. I find this to be a particularly difficult vice to avoid, and thus, this Lent, once again need to confess this sin in myself.
