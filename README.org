Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent: The church season centered around fasting and penitence, full of reminders of our sin and the price that Jesus paid to redeem us.

Our reading today focuses on two basic points:

1. That fasting is a religious practice that is susceptible to hypocrisy: “Look at how good I am; I’m giving [this or that] up for Lent”. Jesus doesn’t tell us not to fast; rather, he tells us that we shouldn’t make a show of it.
2. “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”. Our treasure is our priority. We treasure what we love. When we love or treasure anything more than God, we are guilty of breaking the First Commandment.

Mammon is an old word. It’s such an old word that newer translations of the Bible have replaced it with money. Mammon is essentially wealth. Something to be used, but definitely not to be worshiped. I’m reminded of [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%206%3A6-10&version=ESV][1 Timothy 6:6–10]]

If we truly fear, love, and trust in God above all things, then we have no reason to be overly concerned with mammon. We can invest it, spend it, and generally be good stewards of it when we have it, but it need not consume us. I find this to be a particularly difficult vice to avoid, and thus, this Lent, once again need to confess this sin in myself.
** Prayer:
“Lord Jesus, help us to treasure all that You have done for us, and by Your Spirit to avoid the snares of the devil, the world, and our sinful nature. Amen.” (Baikie et. al., 2022)

* Thursday after Ash Wednesday -- March 3, 2022
** Bible Reading: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11%3A23-34&version=ESV][1 Corinthians 11:23-34]]
** Reflections:

Interestingly, today's devotional reading contains the Words of Institution of the Lord's Supper, or Eucharist. There are many points that could be considered here, but insofar as a daily Lenten reflection goes, I'll keep it brief:

"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself." (vv. 27-29)

I think the aforementioned verses are self-explanatory, but there remains yet one other thing to be said this morning, and that is that we Christians approach the altar to receive Jesus' body and blood under the understanding that
1. ...the means by which Jesus purchases and wins us from all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil is not with gold or silver, but rather, with his holy, precious blood and with his innocent suffering and death.
2. ...one of the means by which we receive this is through bodily eating and drinking.

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A17-30&version=ESV][Matthew 26:17-30]]

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A32-33&version=ESV][John 6:32-33]]

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A40&version=ESV][John 6:40]]

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A22-24&version=ESV][Hebrews 12:22-24]]

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1 Corinthians+10%3A16&version=ESV][1 Corinthians 10:16]]

   [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A24&version=ESV][1 Peter 2:24]]

3. ...we should approach the table with a believing heart that the gift is truly for us. After all, Jesus says in Matthew 26 that it is 'Given and shed for you for the forgivness of sins'.

To me, this seems quite relevant to the subject of Lent, because we go to receive Holy Communion, or the Eucharist, under the presupposition that we are sinners in need of forgiveness, acknowledging that therein we receive forgivness of sins, life, and salvation.

** Prayer:
"Lord Jesus, help us to faithfully seek out the forgiveness You earned at the cross
in the things You have promised to deliver that forgiveness through. Amen." (Baikie et. al, 2022)

** Bible Reading: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+2%3A5-11&version=ESV][2 Corinthians 2:5-11]]
** Reflections:

"...so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs." (vs. 11)

This is an especially tough reading for me, because I am dispositionally a very unforgiving person. For example, I might come up with a psychologicali or biological explanation for why someone might have raped me as a 10-year-old, but in the back of my mind I'm reducing him to a clinical case in the best of circumstances, and subhuman in the worst. I go out of my way to not consider it a sin, because if it's a sin, then that means that, if I want to have peace, it is on me to bury the hatchet; that is, to forgive.

Similarly, if someone breaks a promise, I try to analyze what all led up to her forgetting to keep it, and try to institute elaborate systems of reminders and so-on, but that again is an attempt at mechanizing a solution instead of interacting on a human-to-human level, discussing the hurt, and forgiving.

Forgiving, for me, is much harder than distancing myself from the pain of a situation and trying to explain it away. Explaining it away at least gives the hope of me being able to somehow take responsibility for the situation, for whatever I might have done or failed to do; If only I had finagled to not be in the wrong place at the wrong time; If only I had given enough reminders; If only I had used more persuasive speaking techniques; If only... Letting others actualy be responsible for their actions is difficult for me, because that means letting go of a great deal of the perceived control I have of a situation. That literally means that if someone hurts me, I have to contend with that hurt; with the possibility that the hurt may (and likely will) come again; that sometimes there is nothing I can do to prevent others from hurting me. The point is literally to forgive in spite of the pain and that's nigh impossible for me.

Now, there is the hope of being able to confront someone with their sin, but there is no guarantee that this will have the desired outcome. At least, within the context of the Church, there is a system that tends to work well, if it's actually implemented: [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&version=ESV][Matthew 18:15-17]]. Now, the bit about 'if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector' doesn't give the license to be hateful to him; rather to simply acknowledge that he's not a member of the Church anymore, and point him back to the loving, forgiving arms of Jesus, the Word, and the Sacraments by which he can again receive forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation.

Satan's designs are to sow discord within the Church. Lack of forgiveness plays right into this plan. Yes, there is a means of outsting the folks who decide to be unrepentant in their sin, but there are also means of grace to forgive and strengthen those who are repentant. And part of being a Christian is to not shy away from talking about sin and letting the person get away with repeatedly hurting someone, but rather to lovingly confront him and to forgive. That is literally all any of us has the power to do. However disagreeable the confrontation might be, it seems to me that often the only way to having peace is to actually go through the entire process of indicating the wrongdoing to the wrongdoer; to go through the possibility of denials and arguments; to give a chance for reconciliation to take place; to go through the process as slowly as needs dictate as opposed to trying to 'cut it off, stitch it up, and forget about it as soon as possible'. It may be harder, but loving confrontation (if geography and circumstance allow) and forgiveness (not optional) is always the best option.

I say this in profound need of this reminder on a daily basis. Neither should I forget that Jesus has us pray "And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us".

What does this mean? 'We pray in this petition that our Father in heaven would not look upon our sins, nor deny such petitions on account of them; for we are worthy of none of the things for which we pray, neither have we deserved them; but that He would grant them all to us by grace; for we daily sin much, and indeed deserve nothing but punishment. So will we verily, on our part, also heartily forgive and also readily do good to those who sin against us.' (SC)
